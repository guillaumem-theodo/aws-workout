# Add four subnets in the VPC

## Your mission
1Ô∏è‚É£ Create four non-overlapping subnets: 
- net-102-subnet-1 with nearly 256 IPs in the first AZ in the region
- net-102-subnet-2 with nearly 256 IPs in the second AZ in the region
- net-102-subnet-3 with nearly **4096 IPs** in the first AZ in the region
- net-102-subnet-4 with nearly **4096 IPs** in the second AZ in the region

NB: With Terraform you can get AZ name using: ``data.aws_availability_zones.all.names`` array values

üèÅ Test the Created subnets using AWS CLI `aws ec2 describe-subnets`

## Support
You select the size of the subnet using the subnet IPv4 CIDR.

‚ö†Ô∏è A subnet belongs to **ONE** VPC.

‚ö†Ô∏è A subnet spans in ONE and ONLY ONE REGION (since it is in one VPC which itself is in ONE region)

‚ö†Ô∏è A subnet spans in ONE and ONLY ONE AVAILABILITY ZONE in the Region.

#### Private / Public subnets
**PUBLIC subnets** are subnets that have **routes** from and to internet. It is NOT a flag. It is the configuration of the network (route tables...) that make the subnet PUBLIC.

**PRIVATE subnets** are subnets WITHOUT **route** FROM internet. Private Subnets CAN have route TO internet.
