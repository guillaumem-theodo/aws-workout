## Understand EC2 metadata service

1) Similarly to `2-computing/202` exercise, start an EC2 with user-data script to install a http server and serve html pages.
In the html page, üëâ try to display the public IP v4.

In order to do so, you can rely on 'MetaData Service' exposed by AWS:

From within the EC2 (inside the User-Data script for example):
```bash
curl 169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/public-ipv4
```

`169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data` exposes some valuable information:
- public IPv4 of the EC2 (you can't find this information using linux `ifconfig` command. This command only exposes private IPs)
- public keys (ssh)
- metrics
- public-hostname
- ami...

2) Add a S3 bucket (with you own unique name)

3) Try to list S3 bucket content from within the EC2

‚ùå WITHOUT STORING YOUR CREDENTIALS IN THE EC2 ‚ùå Storing credentials directly in EC2 is a BAD habit.

```bash
aws S3 ls s3://bucket-name
```
