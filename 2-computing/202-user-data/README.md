## A Simple EC2 with a User-Data Script

When bootstrapping an EC2, a **User-Data** script can be executed.  
The script is launched ONLY at first boot-time. It is not executed on RESTART.

## Your mission

1️⃣ Create a networking infrastructure (VPC, subnets, RouteTable, SecurityGroup, Internet Access)
- Use VPC and Subnets from `1-networking/101` and `1-networking/102` tutorials
- Add an Internet Gateway and accesses to/from internet (see `1-networking/104` tutorial)
- In a new Security group, Allow ports:
  - SSH only **from your IP**
  - ICMP only **from your IP**
  - 👉 HTTP from everywhere

2️⃣ Start a new EC2 with a **User-Data script**
- In the EC2 definition, add a User-Data script.
- In the script you can update the linux packages
- In the script you can install a service (e.g. Apache httpd)

Example of script to be used:
```
sudo su
yum update -y
yum install -y httpd
systemctl start httpd
systemctl enable httpd
echo "Hello World from $(hostname -f)" > /var/www/html/index.html
```

</div>
<br>

## Your success
🏁 Once installed, the EC2 should be able to serve your html page.  
You may have to wait some seconds, so the EC2 can download, update, install and start httpd service during bootstrap.

- ✅ Test that you can see the webpage from your browser
- ✅ Use Curl to test the page
- ✅ Check that HTTPD service started in script is running using `service httpd status` command in EC2

You can use following commands to check your mission success
```shell
./launch.sh 2-computing/202-user-data/TEST-curl.sh
./launch.sh 2-computing/202-user-data/TEST-ssh-public-ec2.sh
./launch.sh 2-computing/202-user-data/TEST-check-httpd-service.sh
```
