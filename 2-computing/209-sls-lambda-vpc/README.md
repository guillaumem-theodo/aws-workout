## Lambda With a VPC access in order to access private S3 VPC Endpoint

‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê (more complexe)Ô∏è ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

‚ö†Ô∏èÔ∏è For this workout you will need to install **Serverless Framework**

As in `208 sls lambda` workout, we are going to deploy a Lambda to Enumerate an S3 bucket.

But in this workout, the S3 will be:
- accessed through a VPC Endpoint (Gateway Endpoint) (see `107` workout)
- protected to accept accesses ONLY from VPC Endpoint

As a consequence, the Lambda will have to be `attached` to the VPC (to be able to use the VPC Endpoint).

1Ô∏è‚É£ Same construct than in `208` workout

2Ô∏è‚É£ Add a S3 VPC Endpoint in the VPC (`107` workout)

3Ô∏è‚É£ Add a S3 Policy that blocks access on Read operations coming from other way than VPC Endpoint.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Associate the Lambda to the VPC (security group and subnet)
In `serverless.ts` file.

üèÅ Test S3 Enumeration
- ‚ùå Enumerate S3 objects from your laptop `aws s3 ls s3:\\bucketname`  (using your credential stored in profile). Should be KO since your lapop is not in the VPC
- ‚úÖ Enumerate S3 objects from the EC2 `aws s3 ls s3:\\bucketname` (using the EC2 role)
- ‚úÖ Enumerate S3 objects using the exposed API (using the Lambda Role)
