# ASG - Auto Scaling Group

‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê (more complex)Ô∏è ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

Instead of creating a fixed finite number of workers, like in `205-alb` workout, we are going to ask AWS to start or stop workers depending on the traffic load.

The ALB target Group will not be linked anymore to EC2 Targets but to an *Auto Scaling Group* (ASG).

An ASG is made of:
- **a launch template** or **a launch configuration**: definition of the type of EC2 to start (cpu, ram, AMI...) - **WHAT** TO LAUNCH
- **scaling options**: definition of the desired number min/max of instances, conditions to start/stop,... - **WHEN** TO LAUNCH

## Your mission

üëâ From the 101-basic-vpc and 102-basic-subnets AND 206-alb

You will have to combine many topics seen in previous exercises.

1Ô∏è‚É£ Like in `Workout 205`, create a Bastion Architecture,
- with a public subnet / sg for ALB (HTTP from everywhere)
- with a limited subnet / sg for Bastion (SSH access from your IP only)
- with a private subnet / sg for workers (HTTP from ALB subnet, SSH from bastion subnet)

üëâ BUT do not create manually the three EC2 workers !!!

2Ô∏è‚É£ Instead of a finite number of workers, 
- create a `launch template`, that describe how your EC2 will be created dynamically
- create an `Auto Scaling Group` (ASG) that reference the launch template`
- register the ASG inside the Application Load Balancer

### Organise your files (Terraform Tutorial)
You can split the TERRAFORM file, in multiple files in the same directory.
You can create:
- a `main.tf` file with the ALB and ASG
- a `network.tf` file with the subnets and routes/route tables
- a `security.tf` file with the security groups
- a `workers.tf` file with the Launch Template

### Organise your files (CDK Tutorial)
You can split the CDK stack, in multiple Nested Stack
You can create:
- one Nested Stack for `Networking` (VPC, subnets, NAT, IGW, Routes, SecurityGroups...)
- one Nested Stack for `ASG` (ALB, TargetGroups, ASG, LaunchTemplate, Listeners, Bastion...)
- one Parent Stack as the root stack

## Your success
üèÅ Test that the load is handled by different workers
- ‚úÖ Check that the CURL on the ALB URL is served by different workers.
- ‚úÖ Stop manually an EC2 (one of the worker), observe that the ASG restart a new one

- You can use following commands to check your mission success
  ```shell
  ./launch.sh 2-computing/206-auto-scaling/TEST-ssh-public-ec2.sh
  ./launch.sh 2-computing/206-auto-scaling/TEST-load-balancer.sh
  ```
