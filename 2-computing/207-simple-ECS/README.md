## ECS - FARGATE : Managed Cluster

‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê (more complex)Ô∏è ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

ECS is an AWS Service for Containers Clusters

The **ECS** Service let you provision Tasks and Services.
- **Tasks** are descriptions of the containers to be run
- **Services** are definitions of the desired instances count started from tasks

Services and Containers are run on an **ECS Cluster**.

There are two types of ECS Cluster:
- **EC2** based one. You provision the EC2s underlying the ECS cluster
- **FARGATE** based ECS Cluster; AWS provisions the workers underlying the ECS Cluster.

## Your mission

1Ô∏è‚É£ As in Workout `206 on auto-scaling`:
 - Create a public subnet, and a public security group (in order to create a public facing ALB)
 - Create a private subnet, and a private security group (in order to host ECS workers)
 - Add an Internet Gateway and a public route to internet, associated with the public subnet
 - Add a NAT Gateway (in the public subnet), and a route to internet. Associated it to the private subnet
 - Create an ALB and ALB Target Group üëâ BUT WITHOUT üëà any target
   - Targets will be referenced by IP (and no more by instanceId)

2Ô∏è‚É£ Create an ECS Cluster. 
    - Select `FARGATE` container type. Fargate is a fully managed version of ECS.  You will NOT have to create EC2 to support ECS cluster. 
  
3Ô∏è‚É£ Create an `ECS Task Definition`
  - The task Definition lets you select:
      - the Docker Image (from DockerHub: the private subnet needs access to internet to download image --> NAT gateway), 
        For example, you can select ``httpd:2.4`` Apache image
      - the cpu size (256 means 1/4 V-CPU),
      - the Ram size (512 MB)
  - The networking mode of the Task will be 'awsvpc' (which means that the docker container share the VPC network)
    (see this [doc](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/task-networking-awsvpc.html))

4Ô∏è‚É£ Create an `ECS Service`
  - The service describes how many PODs will be created
  - The service sets the minimum and maximum number of PODs instances
  - The service describes which Task to start (select the Task Definition)
  - üëâ The service must be linked to the ALB TargetGroup
  - üëâ The service must be created AFTER the ALB

### Organise your files (CDK and Terraform Tutorials)
As in previous workouts, create files or Stacks to separate domains.

## Your success
üèÅ Test that the ALB serves the HTTP page
- ‚úÖ Check that the CURL on the ALB URL is served by different workers.

- You can use following commands to check your mission success
  ```shell
  ./launch.sh 2-computing/207-simple-ECS/TEST-load-balancer.sh
  ```
